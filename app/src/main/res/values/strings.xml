    <string name="article_text">In a vault deep inside Abbey Road Studios in London  protected by an unmarked, triple-locked, police-alarmed door  are something like 400 hours of unreleased Beatles recordings, starting from June 2, 1962 and ending with the very last tracks recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album. The best of the best were released by Apple Records in the form of the 3-volume Anthology series.

This volume starts with the first new Beatle song, Free as a Bird (based on a John Lennon demo, found only on <i>The Lost Lennon Tapes Vol. 28</i>, and covers the very earliest historical recordings, outtakes from the first albums, and live recordings from early concerts and BBC Radio sessions.

<b><i>Cry for a Shadow</i></b> - Many a Beatle fanatic started down the outtake road, like I did, with a first listen to this song. Originally titled Beatle Bop and recorded in a single session that yielded four songs (the other three featured Tony Sheridan with the Beatles as a backing band), Cry for a Shadow is an instrumental written by Lennon and Harrison, which makes it unique to this day. John Lennon plays rhythm guitar, George Harrison plays lead guitar, Paul McCartney plays bass, and Pete Best plays drums. The sessions were produced by Bert Kaempfert in Hamburg, Germany, during the Beatles second visit from April through July of 1961 to play in the Reeperbahn-section clubs.

<b><i>One After 909</i></b>  A song recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album was actually worked on way back in the beginning, six years earlier. This take shows how they did it much more slowly, with an R&amp;B feel to it.
